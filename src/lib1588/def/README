This directory contains component macro .def files that are referenced by X-Macros in
the lib1588 source code.

The component macros are used to define message, derived data
types, and management TLV fields.

The X-Macros are used to automatically generate most of
the code used to pack, unpack, display and free ptp data fields.

Most of the mundane message packing, unpacking and case code is
automatically generated. When any field changes have been made
to TLV definitions, code needs re-generated with ./codegen.sh.

Documentation on how to use X-Macros can be found at:
