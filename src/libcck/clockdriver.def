 *
 */


/*
 * Register available clock drivers here (we are so modular...)
 * If not included in the CCK_REGISTER_IMPL context,
 * just include the headers. The CCK_REGISTER_IMPL x-macro
 * arguments are: ENUM_NAME, type_suffix, "text_name"
 * This means that the function and type suffixes in your
 * implementation must match type_suffix.
 */

/*
 * selective builds check for CCK_BUILD_xxx, but CCK_ALL_IMPL causes
 * all macros to be invoked. This is used when including this from
 * the main component header, to preserve a full set of enums.
